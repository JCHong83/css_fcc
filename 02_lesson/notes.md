It is called cascading stylesheet

this means that the stylesheet is read from top to bottom and the last read is applied

Also specificity is applied, this means that a class rule will be applied instead of the element rule no matter the position.

Inheritance : the rule of the higher element will be interited by the child elements. But only typhography related rules will be inherited. Form elements will not tipicly inherit. But you can make them inherit with the inherit rule.
